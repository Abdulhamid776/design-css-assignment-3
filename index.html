                <p class="mid-para">These chocolate-covered strawberries are made with the simplest recipe I know. White chocolate may be drizzled over the milk chocolate for a fancier look. They are perfect for parties, Valentine's Day, and weddings. Decorate with frosting bow ties, bells, butterflies, hearts, roses, etc.
                    You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics

                <p>This is a wonderful recipe. I found the success is really in the quality of chocolate, BUT i had lots ot chocolate chips meant primarily for cookies. Melted the chips but too thick to coat the strawberries. Softened the chocolate with a bit of half and half to the consistancy needed to coat the strawberry and knowing it would not harden well. Decided to freeze chocolate dipped strawberry added chocolate dipped tangerine slices, and chocolate dipped bananas. Served slightly frozen, YUMMY and desert always on han</p>
